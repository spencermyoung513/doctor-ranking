# A Bayesian Approach to Ranking Doctors Based on Historical Performance
In this project, I implement an end-to-end system for ranking doctors based on medical insurance claims data. A demonstration of this system's capabilities can be seen in the `demo.ipynb` notebook.

Code for the Bayesian model I employ can be found in `models`. All code with the logic used to rank doctors resides in the `ranking` directory. My class for interacting with the insurance claims database can be found in `dataloader`.

Disclaimer: The database I used when creating this system is proprietary (and incredibly large) and cannot be hosted remotely on this repository. For more details, please contact me at [spencermyoung513@gmail.com](mailto:spencermyoung513@gmail.com).
